<p style="text-align: center;">What I learned from this project included using Android Studio to create a display with homescreen and simple equations. This involved using CSS to keep images aligned depending on what device the client is using and running the code on the android device simulator. Algebric equations were used by having the input data by a certain percentage to the total amount tipped.

<p style="text-align: center;">I next learned about the use of the coroutines to import information from the web. I found this particularly useful in relevent percentages, and I see how it can be applied when updating pictures or by client input forms. I understand the importance of having that information load fairly swiftly, in order to maintain user attention and smooth app experience. </p>
